### VPC
- A VPC is a logically isolated piece of AWS cloud dedicated to your company. This means, you can run applications on overly provisioned, highly available, and redundant infrastructure setup and it is managed by AWS. All the complexity of setting up a data center with cables, server racks, hardware, power supply, etc. all are managed by AWS.
- A VPC belongs to a region.
- A VPC spans all availability zones.
- You can have multiple VPCs per region.
- VPC contains one or more subnets.
- A Subnet is tied to a single availability zone.
- EC2 instances launch into subnets.
