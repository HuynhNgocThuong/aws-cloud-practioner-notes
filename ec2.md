## What is Amazon EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

- EC2 is one of the most popular of AWSâ€™ offering
- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists in the capability of :
  - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

### EC2 sizing & configuration options

- Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
- How much compute power & cores (CPU)
- How much random-access memory (RAM)
- How much storage space:
  - Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  - hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
- Firewall rules: **security group**
- Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

### EC2 User Data

- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an **EC2 User data** script.
- **bootstrapping** means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is **only run once** at the instance **first start**
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  - Installing updates
  - Installing software
  - Downloading common files from the internet
  - Anything you can think of
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

### EC2 Instance Types - Overview

- You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for different use cases (<https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>)
  - [General Purpose](#general-purpose)
  - [Compute Optimized](#compute-optimized)
  - [Memory Optimized](#memory-optimized)
  - [Storage Optimized](#storage-optimized)
  - Accelerated Computing

- AWS has the following naming convention: m5.2xlarge
- m: instance class
- 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
- 2xlarge: size within the instance class

#### General Purpose

- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
- Balance between:
  - Compute
  - Memory
  - Networking
  
#### Compute Optimized

- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
  - Batch processing workloads
  - Media transcoding
  - High performance web servers
  - High performance computing (HPC)
  - Scientific modeling & machine learning
  - Dedicated gaming servers

#### Memory Optimized

- Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
- Use cases:
  - High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  - Distributed web scale cache stores
  - In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
  - Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

#### Storage Optimized

- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases:
  - High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  - Relational & NoSQL databases
  - Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
  - Data warehousing applications
  - Distributed file systems
 
 ## Introduction to Security Groups

- Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
- They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
- Security groups only contain allow rules
- Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
