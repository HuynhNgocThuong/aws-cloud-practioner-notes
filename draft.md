### AWS Region
-  Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
-  Proximity to customers
-  Available services within a Region
-  Pricing

### AWS Availability Zones
-  Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6)
-  Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
-  They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters
-  They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
